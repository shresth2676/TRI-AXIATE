1. Introduction

The controller is the humanâ€“machine interface (HMI) for operating a 3-DOF robotic arm equipped with a gripper. Its primary function is to provide manual wireless control for precise and safe manipulation of objects.

The robotic arm consists of:

Two servo motors for arm movement (up/down and forward/backward).

One servo motor for gripper actuation (claw open/close).

One stepper motor for rotating the base of the arm.

The controller allows the operator to command the arm intuitively using two joysticks and one potentiometer, with all signals processed and transmitted wirelessly using the NRF24L01 module.

This design ensures compactness, simplicity, and precision while providing flexibility for future upgrades, such as integration with the MPU6050 sensor for automated balance and stability.

2. Hardware Components on Controller
Component	Quantity	Description
Joysticks (with built-in press button)	2	Provides X-Y axis control for servo motors and stepper motor; button used for toggling servo control.
Potentiometer	1	Provides analog input for controlling the gripper servo angle.
NRF24L01 (+PA+LNA)	1	Wireless communication module to transmit controller signals to the arm.
Arduino Pro Mini	1	Main controller board that reads inputs, processes data, and controls wireless transmission.
AMS1117 (3.3V regulator)	1	Supplies stable 3.3V power to NRF24L01.

Notes on Design:

The controller is fully wireless, enabling remote operation without physical constraints.

The potentiometer allows precise control of the gripper to securely hold objects of varying sizes.

The built-in joystick buttons reduce the need for additional hardware switches, simplifying the design.

3. Control Mapping

The following section explains how each input on the controller corresponds to an actuator on the robotic arm:

3.1 Joystick 1

Vertical axis: Controls Servo 1 (arm up/down).

Horizontal axis: Controls Servo 2 (arm forward/backward).

Built-in Button: Toggles control of the vertical axis between Servo 1 and Servo 2.

3.2 Joystick 2

Vertical/Horizontal axes: Controls Stepper Motor for base rotation.

Allows the operator to rotate the entire arm assembly to the desired orientation.

3.3 Potentiometer

Controls Servo 3 (gripper/claw).

Operator can adjust the grip angle to securely hold or release a box.

Provides continuous analog control for precise positioning of the gripper.
